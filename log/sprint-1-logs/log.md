# Sprint 1 Development Log

## Task 1.1: Create CV Upload UI Component

### Steps Completed

1. **Created component structure**

   - Created components/cv-upload-form directory
   - Created CvUploadForm.tsx with proper props typing
   - Created index.tsx for exports

2. **Component Implementation**

   - Implemented file drag & drop functionality
   - Added file validation (size and type checks)
   - Created visual feedback for file selection, upload progress, and errors
   - Implemented responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Ensured dark/light mode compatibility

3. **Storybook Integration**

   - Created CvUploadForm.stories.tsx
   - Implemented stories for default state, error handling, and upload process
   - Added interactive tests using Storybook's play function

4. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Updated the dashboard page to include the CV upload component

### Challenges Faced

1. **Package Installation Issues**

   - Initially intended to use react-dropzone library but encountered pnpm store location issues
   - Solution: Implemented custom drag and drop functionality without external dependencies

2. **Component Dependencies**
   - Needed a Progress component but it wasn't available in the UI components
   - Solution: Created a custom progress bar implementation using Tailwind CSS

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- Implemented comprehensive tests in Storybook
- Tested file validation logic
- Tested UI state for various scenarios (empty, selected, uploading, error)
- Ensured proper styling in both dark and light modes

## Task 1.2: Implement CV Upload API Endpoint

### Steps Completed

1. **Database Schema Updates**

   - Added cv_files table to the database schema
   - Created relationships between users and CV files
   - Added appropriate columns for metadata storage
   - Generated and ran database migrations

2. **API Endpoint Implementation**

   - Created POST endpoint at /api/cv/upload
   - Implemented file validation (type and size)
   - Set up file system storage for uploads
   - Integrated with database for metadata storage

3. **File Access API**
   - Created GET endpoint at /api/cv/files/[id]
   - Implemented authentication and permission checks
   - Configured appropriate content-type headers for downloads

### Challenges Faced

1. **Authentication Integration**

   - Needed to understand the existing authentication system
   - Solution: Integrated with the existing session management system

2. **File Storage**
   - Needed to handle binary file storage and retrieval
   - Solution: Used fs/promises for file operations and Buffer for handling binary data

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- Tested API endpoints manually
- Verified file uploads and retrievals
- Confirmed database entries are created correctly
- Tested error handling for various scenarios

## Task 1.3: Integration & CI Setup for Upload Feature

### Steps Completed

1. **Frontend-Backend Integration**

   - Connected CV upload component to the API endpoint
   - Implemented proper error handling and loading states
   - Ensured file upload progress is displayed correctly

2. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive logs of the implementation process
   - Documented API endpoints and expected responses
   - Added inline comments in code for better maintainability

### Final Result

The CV upload feature is now fully implemented, allowing users to:

- Select CV files by drag & drop or file browser
- Validate file types and sizes
- Upload files to the server with progress indication
- View confirmation of successful uploads

The feature has been integrated into the dashboard, provides appropriate feedback to users, and stores files securely with metadata in the database.
