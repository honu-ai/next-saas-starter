## Starting Sprint 4

Date: Current Date

Starting Sprint 4 with a focus on implementing the editable CV preview component, download functionality, and completing the end-to-end integration of the application.

## Task 4.1: Create Editable CV Preview Component

### Implementation Steps:

1. Created the folder structure for the component at `components/cv-editable-preview/`

2. Developed the main component `CvEditablePreview.tsx`:

   - Implemented state management for editable CV data
   - Created inline editing functionality for all CV sections (name, contact info, summary, work experience, education, skills)
   - Added ability to add/remove work experiences, education entries, and skills
   - Included UI elements for download options (PDF and Markdown)
   - Added save/cancel functionality to persist or revert changes
   - Ensured proper styling with Tailwind CSS for both light and dark modes
   - Added proper loading states for saving and exporting actions

3. Created Storybook stories in `CvEditablePreview.stories.tsx`:

   - Added sample CV data for testing
   - Created multiple stories for different component states and actions
   - Implemented play tests to validate editing functionality
   - Added tests for adding new items (skills, work experience)
   - Added tests for exporting to different formats

4. Created index.tsx to export the component and its type definitions

### Component Features:

- Inline editing: Users can edit each section of the CV individually
- Add/remove functionality: Users can add or remove work experiences, education entries, and skills
- Export options: Users can export their CV as PDF or Markdown
- Responsive design: Works well on different screen sizes
- Dark/light mode support: Consistent styling in both modes

### Next Steps:

Moving on to Task 4.2 to implement the download functionality for the CV in both Markdown and PDF formats.

## Initial Planning

- Component will use Shadcn UI components for consistency
- Will support both dark and light mode
- Will implement inline editing for key CV sections
- Will include save functionality to persist changes

# Sprint 4 Implementation Log

## Task 4.1: Create Editable CV Preview Component

1. Checked the existing code and found that:

   - A `CvEditablePreview` component was already implemented in `components/cv-editable-preview/CvEditablePreview.tsx`
   - The component already had functionality for inline editing of CV data
   - It included buttons for exporting as PDF and Markdown
   - Storybook stories were already written demonstrating its functionality, including export capabilities

2. Integrated the `CvEditablePreview` component into the dashboard page:
   - Updated `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` to replace the existing `CvRewrittenDisplay` component with `CvEditablePreview`
   - Added handlers for saving, PDF export, and Markdown export

## Task 4.2: Implement Download Functionality

1. Found existing download implementation:

   - `lib/cv-export/markdown.ts` - Contains functions for converting CV to Markdown and downloading
   - `lib/cv-export/pdf.ts` - Contains function for downloading CV as PDF

2. Connected the download functions to the dashboard page:

   - Imported the download functions from `@/lib/cv-export`
   - Created handler functions that utilize these existing exports
   - Created a utility function to convert between the two different CV data type formats
   - Connected the handlers to the `CvEditablePreview` component's export buttons

3. Testing:
   - The export buttons in the UI now trigger the corresponding download functions
   - PDF export uses the browser's print functionality
   - Markdown export converts the CV data to a Markdown file and triggers a download

## Next Steps

- Task 4.3: Final Integration and Cleanup
  - Ensure the complete flow works from CV upload to download
  - Confirm all file cleanup happens properly
  - Update documentation with the complete workflow
