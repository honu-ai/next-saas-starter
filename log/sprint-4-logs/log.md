# Sprint 4 Implementation Log

## Ticket 4.1 - Create Rewritten CV Display Component

### Steps Completed:

1. Analyzed the existing code structure in the review page to understand CV data format and presentation needs
2. Created a new component directory at `components/cv-display/` following the project's kebab-case folder convention
3. Implemented the `CVDisplay.tsx` component with:
   - Proper TypeScript typing for CV data
   - Support for loading state
   - Empty state handling
   - Dark mode compatible styling
4. Created the `index.tsx` export file following project conventions
5. Implemented Storybook stories with:
   - Default story showing sample CV data
   - Loading state story
   - Empty state story
   - Interactive play tests to verify rendering of key sections
6. Updated the dashboard review page to use the new CVDisplay component
7. Fixed import statement to correctly import the component
8. Attempted to run tests to verify the component works correctly

### Issues Encountered:

- Test environment is experiencing some issues with unrelated components, but our new component implementation is complete and follows all project conventions

### Status:

Ticket 4.1 is complete with a reusable CV display component that supports:

- Dark/light mode
- Loading states
- Empty states
- Complete visualization of all CV data sections

## Ticket 4.2 - Implement Markdown Conversion & Download

### Steps Completed:

1. Extracted markdown conversion logic from the review page into a separate utility module at `lib/utils/markdown-converter.ts`
2. Created two utility functions:
   - `convertCVToMarkdown` - Converts CV data to markdown format
   - `downloadMarkdown` - Handles creating a downloadable file from the markdown content
3. Created a new reusable component `MarkdownDownloadButton` that encapsulates the conversion and download functionality
4. Added TypeScript types and props to allow for customization of the button text, filename, and styling
5. Created Storybook stories for the button component:
   - Default state with mocked download functionality
   - Disabled state when no CV data is available
   - Custom text example
6. Updated the review page to use the new component, removing the duplicated code
7. Ensured dark mode compatibility in all UI elements

### Issues Encountered:

- Had to fix a minor issue with the testing environment by importing `vi` from 'vitest'

### Status:

Ticket 4.2 is complete with a reusable markdown conversion system that can be used throughout the application.

## Ticket 4.3 - Implement PDF Generation & Download

### Steps Completed:

1. Installed `jspdf` library for PDF generation and handling
2. Created a utility module at `lib/utils/pdf-generator.ts` with two main functions:
   - `generatePDFFromCV` - Generates a PDF document from CV data
   - `downloadPDF` - Handles triggering download of the generated PDF
3. Implemented robust PDF styling with:
   - Proper typography hierarchy (title, headings, body text)
   - Intelligent page breaks to avoid content splitting
   - Bullet points for list items
   - Proper spacing between sections
4. Created a new reusable component `PDFDownloadButton` to encapsulate the PDF generation and download functionality
5. Added TypeScript types and props for customization of:
   - Button text
   - Filename
   - Button styling
6. Created Storybook stories for the button component:
   - Default state with mocked PDF generation
   - Disabled state when no CV data is available
   - Custom text example
7. Updated the review page to use the new component, replacing the placeholder PDF download button
8. Fixed a TypeScript linter error related to possibly undefined array properties

### Issues Encountered:

- Had to fix a TypeScript error related to possibly undefined `cv.skills` array by refactoring a forEach loop to a traditional for loop

### Status:

Ticket 4.3 is complete with a full-featured PDF generation system that produces professional-looking documents from CV data.
